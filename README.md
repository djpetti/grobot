# GroBot
Software and hardware designs for the GroBot project.

## Hardware

This branch contains hardware schematics for GroBot. This is currently still
being heavily worked on, and is nowhere near production ready. If you're
interested, however, you can view and edit the schematics in [Kicad](http://kicad-pcb.org/).
Schematics for the base module and grow module are located in the schematics directory.

For more information, please see the [hardware page](https://github.com/djpetti/grobot/wiki/Hardware)
on the Wiki.
